# auto_mouse_move_simulator-arduino
This program is meant for Arduino Leonardo. (Tested Working Code)
This can be used for keeping the computer active or prevent it from going to sleep. 
This basically acts as an external hardware mouse.

There is no hardware connections required for this project.
For re-programming the Arduino Leonard board, it is required to short PIN #12 and GND.
